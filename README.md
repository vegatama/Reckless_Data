# Reckless Motorcycle Riders Smartphone Sensors

The data presented is the result of experiments conducted to simulate reckless riding behavior with motorcycles. Data collection was conducted with the aim of predicting three types of aggressive driving: aggressive acceleration, aggressive deceleration, and aggressive lane changing, as illustrated. There are two files containing experiments performed on different motorcycles, namely Yamaha Aerox 155 and Honda Scoopy FI.

The experiments were conducted according to the image shown, where each labeled scenario was executed 3 times per vehicle. The file naming format is as follows:

## (Label)_(Initial Speed/Direction)_(Data Collection)

The labels consist of 6 categories:

* AA: Aggressive Acceleration
* AN: Normal Acceleration
* DA: Aggressive Deceleration
* DN: Normal Deceleration
* PLA: Aggressive Lane Change
* PLN: Normal Lane Change
